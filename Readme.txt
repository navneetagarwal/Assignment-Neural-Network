Concept Used:
It's a simple neural network. It has 57 input features and 1 output feature. Initially, a random vector is assigned to the weights. Then it is forward propagated and back propagated to reduce the error. This is done for 100 iterations. And as done for sigmoid the threshold is kept at 0.5, we classify the points to be 0 or 1. Idea of the neural network is applied by taking inspiration from some programs available on the internet and the slides provided.

feedForwardAlgo does the forward propagation 
backPropagate does the back propagation
